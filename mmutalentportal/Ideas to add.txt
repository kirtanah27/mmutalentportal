    - news
    - forum_threads
    - forum_replies

- updated navbar for talent-role, buyer-role and admin-role (not sure what to do for Cart)

Things to add:
- Add auto-login after registration

- Add manage students page for admin-role (maybe to delete any user)




Key areas for further development/refinement if you wish to fulfill all proposal details:

Admin Dashboard (index.php for Admin): Display actual statistics (total users, etc.) instead of just buttons.
Student Account Page (student_manage.php): Add "edit" and "deactivate" functionality for user accounts.
Talent Page (catalogue_manage.php): Add "approve/reject/flag" functionality for talent posts, and filtering within the admin view.
